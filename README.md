# AppleTracker

# TODO
1. Create Database Schema
2. Create scrapper to get data from Apple.com
3. Add data to database
4. Create REST API
5. Create UI

Going to start with getting all recent software versions, iOS, iPadOS, etc, then will focus on current product lines, iPhone, iPad etc. Then will focus on updating the backlog

# Credits
Heavily inspired by [Mactracker](https://mactracker.ca/), but wanted to make the updates quicker, not require a new app update to see the new data
